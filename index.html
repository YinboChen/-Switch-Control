			<h2>About this app</h2>			
			<ol>
			<li><h3>Instructions for using the app</h3>
			<p>This app provides four versions which can be controlled with one key, two keys, three keys and five keys.</p>
			<h3>In the one key version</h3>
			<ul >
				<li>Each button on calculator will be selected automatically. </li>
				<li>You can using "q" key to input the selected item for calculation.</li>
				<li>You can input time as a parameter to change cycle rate. </li>

			</ul>

			<h3>In the two keys version</h3>
			<ul >
				<li>You can using "q" key to input the selected item for calculation.</li>
				<li>Using "d" key to select the next item.</li>

			</ul>

			<h3>In the three keys version</h3>
			<ul >
				<li>Using "q" key to input the selected item for calculation.</li>
				<li>Using "d" key to select the next item.</li>
				<li>Using "a" key to select the previous item.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>In the five keys version</h3>
			<ul >
				<li>Using "q" key to input the selected item for calculation.</li>
				<li>Using "d" key to select the next item.</li>
				<li>Using "a" key to select the previous item.</li>
				<li>Using "w" key to select the above item.</li>
				<li>Using "s" key to select the below item.</li>
			</ul></li>
		
			<li><h3>Mini-tests</h3>
			<p>Experiment Setting: </p>
			<p>Calculating the formula "(945+76-13)*20/8= " which uses all of the keys on the calculator.</p>
			<p>Using each version(except the one key version) with hand and stylus which be holded by teeth(using mouth pen for short). </p>
			<p>Using one key scanning version with different scan speeds(300ms, 500ms, 1000ms and 1500ms). </p>

			<li><h3>Data analysising</h3>
			<p>Comparing the one key, two keys, three keys and five keys version, it shows that operation by hand spent the less time </p>
			<p>than operation by others such as using mouth pen in these experiments. It took the least amount of time only 23.16 s to </p>
			<p>completed the calculation when using five keys version by hand. When using the two keys version and three keys versions </p>
			<p>by hand, the operating time is similar, but comparing the data with mouth pen, it shows that the two keys version took the</p>
			<p>longest time, significantly longer than the three keys version which using the mouth pen. So according to the data, </p>
			<p>it should avoid operating two keys version when using different parts of body as input medium. </p>
			<p>In addition, the operating time of three keys version and five keys version by the mouth pen were similar. It indicted </p>
			<p>that number of keys is not the main factor when using unfamiliar input medium such as the mouth pen in this case.</p>
			<p>Moreover, it’s very interesting to operating the one key version with different speeds. It can’t operate when speed was </p>
			<p>300ms due to excessive error rate, the error rate was almost 100%. When speed was reduced to 500ms, there was still one- fifth</p>
			<p>of the turnover rate. Through the data shows that operating time is proportional to scanning speed. It means that operating </p>
			<p>the one key version needs to trade-off the error rate and scanning speed. Unfortunately, the more accuracy data was not recorded </p>
			<p>in these experiments.</p>
